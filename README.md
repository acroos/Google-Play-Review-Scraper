Google-Play-Review-Scraper
==========================

This simple ruby script can be used to harvest all of the reviews from the google play store for any app.  To use this tool simply run the following command from your terminal:
```
ruby review_scraper.rb "Application Name" results_file.txt
```

This will result in a new file being created with the text of all of the reviews.  If you would like to specify the number of reviews, simply enter the number of the command line:
```
ruby review_scraper.rb "Application Name" results_file.txt number_of_reviews
```

Please let me know if I can add anything.  Enjoy :)
